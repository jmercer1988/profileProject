      <p>
        This is a collection of Angular components and services designed for learning and practicing key concepts:
      </p>
  
      <h2>Parent-Child Component Relationships</h2>
      <p>
        The library emphasizes the use of parent and child components to manage data flow and create modular UIs.
      </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li><b>Parent Components:</b> Responsible for fetching data, handling logic, and passing data down to child components.</li>
        <li><b>Child Components:</b> Focus on presenting the data and emitting events back to the parent component.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Dumb (Presentational) Components</h2>
      <p>
        Many of the components in this library are "dumb" or presentational components. This means:
      </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>They primarily focus on displaying data received through inputs ('Input').</li>
        <li>They notify their parent of user interactions through events ('Output').</li>
        <li>They have minimal internal logic and don't directly depend on external services.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        Explore the different components in this library to see these concepts in action. You'll find examples of:
      </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Headers and footers with customizable links.</li>
        <li>Cards for displaying information.</li>
        <li>Forms with two-way data binding.</li>
        <li>Toast notifications for user feedback.</li>
        <li>...and more!</li>
      </ul>
